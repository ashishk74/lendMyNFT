Our smart contract LendMyNFT is scheduled to give 70% loan in USDC to any borrower against NFT as a collateral.

Testing is done on Rinkeby testnet using USDC available from contract address 0xeb8f08a975Ab53E34D8a0330E0D34de942C95926.

User runs the function borrow(), stating the NFT contract address, tokenId (#1, to be staked) , price (0.01,  in USDC) and endTime of loan (1651514633, unix timestamp).
